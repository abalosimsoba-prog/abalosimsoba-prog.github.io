# Hello! I am Kouyakou-Abalo SIMSOBA 👋

[cite_start]I am a **Google DeepMind Scholar** currently pursuing an **M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence for Science** at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), South Africa[cite: 14, 15, 16]. 

[cite_start]My research focuses on **Robust Machine Learning** and **Time Series Forecasting**[cite: 8, 9]. [cite_start]I specialize in developing resilient deep learning models, such as my work on hybrid Minkowski–Log–Cosh loss functions, to ensure accurate predictions even when dealing with noisy or outlier-contaminated data in public health[cite: 33, 36, 39].
