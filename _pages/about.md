# Hello! I am Kouyakou-Abalo SIMSOBA 👋

I am a **Google DeepMind Scholar** currently pursuing an **M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence for Science** at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), South Africa. 

My research focuses on **Robust Machine Learning** and **Time Series Forecasting**. I specialize in developing resilient deep learning models, such as my work on hybrid Minkowski–Log–Cosh loss functions, to ensure accurate predictions even when dealing with noisy or outlier-contaminated data in public health.

Research Interests
