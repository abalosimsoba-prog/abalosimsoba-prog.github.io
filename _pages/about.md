# Hello! I am Kouyakou-Abalo SIMSOBA 👋

I am a **Google DeepMind Scholar** currently pursuing an **M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence for Science** at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), South Africa. 

My research focuses on **Robust Machine Learning** and **Time Series Forecasting**, with a particular emphasis on developing resilient deep learning models for epidemiological and scientific data. I recently developed a hybrid Minkowski–Log–Cosh loss function to enhance the robustness of LSTM models against noisy data.

Research Interests
======
* **Robust Machine Learning:** Developing algorithms resilient to outliers and noise.
* **Deep Learning:** Time series forecasting and hybrid architectural design.
* **Explainable AI (XAI):** Building transparent models for scientific discovery.
* **Natural Language Processing:** Exploring the capabilities of Large Language Models.
