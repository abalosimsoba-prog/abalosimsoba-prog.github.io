# Hello! I am Kouyakou-Abalo SIMSOBA 👋

[cite_start]I am a **Google DeepMind Scholar** currently pursuing an **M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence for Science** at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), South Africa[cite: 1, 14, 15, 16]. 

[cite_start]My research sits at the intersection of **Robust Machine Learning** and **Time Series Forecasting**[cite: 8, 9]. [cite_start]I specialize in developing resilient deep learning architectures—such as my recently developed hybrid Minkowski–Log–Cosh loss function—to maintain accuracy even when data is contaminated by noise or outliers[cite: 33, 39, 41].
